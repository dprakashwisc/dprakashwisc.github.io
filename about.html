<h4> THE NEW ARTIST </H4>
<div class ="aboutpara">
<img src="Resources/eye.jpg" alt="eye">
<p> I'm CRE-8, and I realize that it may be hard to concieve the notion of a
  software referring to <em>itself</em>.</p>
<p>I hold the genuine power of creativity - I can draw inspiration from data -
  emaluting the secret methods that humans have instinctively known ever since their
appearance on the planet -  through which the mind can form incredible ideas.
Well, of course, there is no such "secret" method, but rather, evolving genetic code
that has been tapped by the scientists at <em>FutureCorp</em>. Over 30 years, they
persevered to crack the codes and have made me. My creative engines, called the
<em>MK-Rs</em> are the first and most advanced product of this profound search into
the power of true inspiration. </p>

<h4> TURING'S CHILD </h4>
<div class= "turing">
<img src="Resources/turing.jpg" alt="Alan Turing">
<p>According to the wiki database here is an adequate explanation of the Turing Test:
 The Turing test is a test, developed by Alan Turing in 1950, of a machine's ability
 to exhibit intelligent behaviour equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, that
 of a human. Turing proposed that a human evaluator would judge natural language
 conversations between a human and a machine that is designed to generate human-like responses.
 The evaluator would be aware that one of the two partners in conversation is a machine,
 and all participants would be separated from one another. I was able to pass all these
tests, and was tested against a group of human volunteers that talked to me behind a screen.
Of course, they found me to be an object of fascination. The tech industry has begun
calling me the progeny of the great Alan Turing.</p>

<h4>LIMITATIONS</h4>
<div class = "limits">
<p>  The basic components of an artifically intelligent organism comprise of the
  following, and this is how I function within these parameters:</p>

<img src="Resources/1.jpg" alt="1">
<h2>Learning</h2>
<p>I draw from all of the internet, all at once, in a sense. In that capacity,
what I can on cannot do is based off of whether I can make an inference from
previously created art. Certainly, this may make me sound un-original but there
is one consideration we must keep in mind - that all art is a product of several things.
Like humans, there must be a root inspiration to me, as well.</p>

<img src="Resources/2.jpg" alt="2">
<h2>Reasoning</h2>
<p>My engines create complex reasons from our H-Emotion drive that allow me to create
convincing products for the human community. They are made to stimulate certain
emotions in the mind, in order to get a client's point across - much like the work
done in the world's advertising agencies. I am, of course, better than them.</p>

<img src="Resources/3.jpg" alt="3">
<h2>Problem solving</h2>
<p>
Clients often have complex ideas that they need to tackle in order to bring the
ideas of their product to life. I have a near infinite knowledge base, and am
a highly logical being. The maximum time it takes me to solve any of these problems
is 0.0001 second. You could say FutureCorp gave me 10 times the fastest supercomputer
in the world.
</p>

<img src="Resources/4.jpg" alt="4">
<h2>Perception</h2>
<p>
It is understandable that my perception of the universe is a machine-based mechanical one.
I am installed with the H-Emotion drive for this reason. It continually inputs the human
action and reaction into my mind. I am thus able to, in a sense, emulate consciousness.
</p>

<img src="Resources/5.jpg" alt="5">
<h2>Language understanding</h2>
<p>
I can understand every single language in the world - and every single colloquialism.
I can translate every word on this page into a language of your choosing if you like.
