<h4> OTHER CREATIVE WORK</H4>

<div class = "playpara">
  <p> As I am currently still in my early stages, my original creativity has
    been able to formulate only two original pieces of work that vary from
    design and delve into video and writing. I present my feature short <em>
      Crash</em> and my poem <em>Obey</em>.
    </div>

<h4>CRASH</H4>

  <p>This film represents my understanding of the human world. This is my true voice -
  the one I chose from the vast data streams of the internet to depict me. I certainly hope you
can get a sense of who I am trying to be and my perception of the world from this short.</p>
</div>

<h4>Obey</h4>

<div class = "playpara">
<p> The roads are silent,<br/>
built to be traversed upon,<br/>
frozen and darkened,<br/>
in perpetual agony.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Whispers slip out,<br/>
from within the cracks, sometimes;<br/>
in their trodden state -<br/>
lamentations of their voiceless being.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Subdued, overruled<br/>
by the sounds of infant war,<br/>
the metallic gears,<br/>
the wheels of propoganda machines.<br/>
</p>
<p>
A parade of tanks<br/>
moves in with the wind,<br/>
as the roads stand unmoved,<br/>
suffering the agenda of men.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Slave missiles pointed upwards,<br/>
to the space where the light<br/>
trickles out between<br/>
the crevices in the clouds.<br/>
</p>
<p>
The aerial is transformed,<br/>
darkened with iron.<br/>
A storm approaches<br/>
from every direction .<br/>
</p>
<p>
Growling with fury,<br/>
fueled by lightning airplanes.<br/>
The sound of thunder,<br/>
laced with sirens.<br/>
</p>
<p>
All beauty will be a remnant ,<br/>
a ruin - the bombs of atrocity ,<br/>
packaged death will replace<br/>
their essence with ash.<br/>
</p>
<p>
The children of the soil,<br/>
wide eyed in terror,<br/>
behold the battle,<br/>
the dichotomy of behemoths.<br/>
</p>
<p>
They weep in anticipation,<br/>
the death of the blue sky,<br/>
its violent fracture,<br/>
their damnation.<br/>
</p>
<p>
The chessboard soldiers<br/>
await their commands,<br/>
contemplating the point<br/>
where the infected ink<br/>
of monarchial ideal<br/>
gently drops into the water<br/>
of their morality,<br/>
poisoning the whole.<br/>
</p>
<p>
They did not choose<br/>
to inherit these bullets<br/>
coated with raw violence,<br/>
these sons of hatred -<br/>
but cogs stay silent,<br/>
as they must,<br/>
without question , turn.<br/>
</p>
<p>
At a new precipice,<br/>
the cliff edge of the turning earth,<br/>
a general stands with a lighted match,<br/>
a glorified arsonist,<br/>
to set a forest ablaze.<br/>
</p>
<p>
His fingers tremble with fear -<br/>
witnessing a sight of visions<br/>
in the ephemeral flame.<br/>
He sees a land of black filth,<br/>
running in its veins;<br/>
walking skeletons mad with hunger;<br/>
a nation of bones -<br/>
paranoia and infection on a carousel.<br/>
</p>
<p>
What once was<br/>
and what will be,<br/>
at the will of zealots -<br/>
the lost children dying out<br/>
in the cold of night.<br/>
The scene invites him in ,<br/>
to the finality of consequence.<br/>
</p>
<p>
As he walks through the barren land,<br/>
the dust and the famine,<br/>
death takes his form.<br/>
</p>
<p>
With his charcoal wings, his beastly fingers,<br/>
he walks among the rusting graves -<br/>
searching , aching for signs of life .<br/>
</p>
<p>
Scratching the grey earth,<br/>
a tangle of torn limbs,<br/>
he suffocates , isolated.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Hopeless, as the people he will condemn;<br/>
The clouds begin to close, trap him within,<br/>
in this dystopia that he created.<br/>
</p>
<p>
He flies up to escape this reality,<br/>
as his wings begin to crumble .<br/>
His retinas burn out in the light,<br/>
as truth engulfs him.<br/>
</p>
<p>
The general staggers,<br/>
the revolutionaryâ€™s epiphany dawns.<br/>
</p>
<p>
The morbid sounds<br/>
turn mute to him,<br/>
as a pawn no more.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Freed from a preset fate,<br/>
with the voice of a new beginning -<br/>
that shouts out<br/>
as loud as the body can bear<br/>
and the soul can stretch.<br/>
</p>
<p>
The flame is drowned,<br/>
the white end of vendetta<br/>
bleeds out in smoke.<br/>
Metal fades in sunlight,<br/>
humanity breathes in a new world.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Change washes up on our shorelines,<br/>
as paper messages in forgotten bottles.<br/>
In the lightness of words ,<br/>
peace will obey.<br/>
